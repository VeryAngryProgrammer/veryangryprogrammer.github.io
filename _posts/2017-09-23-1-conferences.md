## Programming Conferences - Things That Make Me Angry

_This post is the first in a series on things that make me angry. If this post on things that makes me angry happens to make you angry, I've created an easy script that you can use to [send me hate mail](https://github.com/VeryAngryProgrammer/hate-mail-script)._

Programming conferences can be great fun, but they can also be a hive for obnoxious morons. I would rather spend a weekend with a grumpy Gorilla than some of the people I have been locked in these hell halls with. Here is my list of conference characters that make me angry.

### Quentin the Questioner

Picture the scene.

You never wanted to go to this talk. You are only here because you spent too long at the snack table to get a seat at the better talk on the other track.

The talk was titled "Apache vs. NGINX - War of the Webservers" and contained no useful information that could not be found on the the 'Getting Started' page of their websites.

The 45 minutes allocated for the talk have expired, the next speaker is twitching at the side of the stage (they have already commandeered the HDMI cable and now they are eyeing up the microphone).

Just before the track chair bursts a blood vessel, the speaker has the audacity to ask - "Does anybody have any questions?"

Surprisingly, you actually have quite a few questions, but they're all the long the lines of "Why are you still here?" and "What on earth convinced you that I would want to spend $400 to listen to that?" so you decided against putting your hand up.

Quentin is sat on the front row (obviously), and his hand was up before the speaker had finished the word "anybody". He already knows more than the speaker does on this topic, and he has spent the last 20 minutes constructing the perfect question to prove it.

"In your experience, which of these web servers would work better on my 8 Core Xeon dedicated server with 64GB of RAM? I host about 25 different micro-services and each of them get a few thousands hits every minute. I have turned off .htaccess file parsing and done quite a lot of performance configuration - will Apache still be significantly slower than NGINX? I have found before that better use of static content and application caching can have more of an impact on performance than migrating webserver technology. What do you think?"
